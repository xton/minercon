# Minecraft RCON Terminal

A full-featured RCON client for Minecraft servers — available both as a
**VS Code extension** (integrated terminal panel) and as a **standalone CLI
tool** (`rcon-minecraft`) that runs in any terminal.

## Features

**Command completion**
- Real-time suggestions as you type, cycling with Tab / Shift+Tab
- Argument hints showing the full usage signature of the current command
- Works with vanilla, Bukkit/Spigot/Paper, and plugin-extended servers
- When the [RconTabComplete](https://github.com/pop4959/RconTabComplete) plugin
  is installed, completions come directly from the server (fastest, most
  accurate). Without it, the extension builds a local command tree by crawling
  `/help` output once per server and caching it.

**Emacs-style line editing**
- Full cursor movement, word-jump, selection, and kill/yank (kill ring shared
  with system clipboard in VS Code; in-process kill ring in the CLI)
- Scrollable command history, persistent across reconnects

**Minecraft color codes** — server responses render with full `§` color support

**Robust connection handling** — exponential-backoff auto-reconnect on drop;
TCP keepalive to detect silent disconnects

**No response truncation** — custom RCON protocol implementation handles
fragmented multi-packet responses correctly (vanilla server `/help` returns
300+ commands in full)

## Server setup

Add these lines to `server.properties` and restart:

```properties
enable-rcon=true
rcon.port=25575
rcon.password=your-secure-password
```

The password is only needed at connect time and is never written to disk by
this tool.

## VS Code extension

### Installation

Search **"Minecraft RCON Terminal"** in the VS Code Extensions panel, or
install from a `.vsix` file:

```
Ctrl+Shift+P → Extensions: Install from VSIX...
```

### Connecting

| Command (Ctrl+Shift+P) | Description |
|---|---|
| Minecraft RCON: Connect to Server | Connect using saved defaults, or prompt if none saved |
| Minecraft RCON: Connect with New Credentials | Always prompt for host, port, and password |
| Minecraft RCON: Save Current Connection as Default | Save the current connection's host and port; password goes to VS Code's secure secret storage |

You can also open a terminal via the **Terminal** menu → **New Terminal** →
select **Minecraft Server** from the terminal profile picker.

Multiple RCON terminals can be open simultaneously, each to a different server.

### VS Code settings

```json
{
  "minecraftRcon.defaultHost": "localhost",
  "minecraftRcon.defaultPort": 25575
}
```

The password is not stored in settings — it lives in VS Code's encrypted
secret storage.

---

## CLI tool

### Installation

```sh
npm install -g minecraft-rcon
```

Or, after cloning and building locally:

```sh
npm run compile
node out/rcon-minecraft --help
```

### Usage

```
rcon-minecraft [host] [port] [options]

Options:
  -p, --password <pw>   RCON password
  --save                Save host/port to ~/.config/minecraft-rcon/config.json
  --log-file <path>     Write log output to a file instead of stderr
  -h, --help            Show help

Environment variables:
  MCRCON_PASSWORD       RCON password (used when --password is not given)
  MCRCON_LOG_FILE       Log file path (used when --log-file is not given)
```

**Password handling:** the CLI never writes the password to disk. Supply it
with `--password`, the `MCRCON_PASSWORD` environment variable, or leave both
unset and you will be prompted with masked input.

**Saved host/port:** `--save` writes host and port (never the password) to
`~/.config/minecraft-rcon/config.json`. On subsequent invocations, those
values are used as defaults so you can just run `rcon-minecraft` with no
arguments.

**Kill/yank:** the CLI uses an in-process kill ring (Ctrl+K stashes text;
Ctrl+Y yanks it back). The kill ring is not connected to the system clipboard.
Ctrl+X / Ctrl+C-with-selection do the same within the session.

**Log output:** diagnostic messages go to stderr by default, colored by level.
Use `--log-file` to redirect them to a file (useful when stderr would
interfere with piped output).

### Quick examples

```sh
# One-off connection (prompts for password)
rcon-minecraft localhost 25575

# Password from environment
MCRCON_PASSWORD=secret rcon-minecraft mc.example.com

# Save host/port for future sessions
rcon-minecraft mc.example.com 25575 --password secret --save

# Next time, no arguments needed
rcon-minecraft
```

## Keyboard shortcuts

### Navigation and completion

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab` | Fetch / cycle to next suggestion |
| `Shift+Tab` | Cycle to previous suggestion |
| `Up` / `Ctrl+P` | Previous command in history (or move up in suggestion list) |
| `Down` / `Ctrl+N` | Next command in history (or move down in suggestion list) |
| `Page Up` / `Page Down` | Page through suggestion list |
| `Esc` | Close suggestion list; if already closed, clear the line |
| `Enter` | Submit the current command |

### Cursor movement

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Left` / `Ctrl+B` | Move left one character |
| `Right` / `Ctrl+F` | Move right one character |
| `Ctrl+Left` / `Alt+B` | Move left one word |
| `Ctrl+Right` / `Alt+F` | Move right one word |
| `Home` / `Ctrl+A` | Move to start of line |
| `End` / `Ctrl+E` | Move to end of line |

### Selection

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Shift+Left` | Extend selection left |
| `Shift+Right` | Extend selection right |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Left` | Extend selection left by word |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Right` | Extend selection right by word |
| `Shift+Home` | Select to start of line |
| `Shift+End` | Select to end of line |

### Editing

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Backspace` | Delete character before cursor |
| `Delete` | Delete character after cursor |
| `Ctrl+T` | Transpose characters around cursor |
| `Ctrl+K` | Kill (cut) from cursor to end of line → kill ring |
| `Ctrl+U` | Kill from cursor to start of line → kill ring |
| `Ctrl+W` / `Alt+Backspace` | Kill word before cursor → kill ring |
| `Alt+D` | Kill word after cursor → kill ring |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Yank (paste) from kill ring |
| `Ctrl+X` | Cut selection → kill ring |
| `Ctrl+C` | Copy selection → kill ring (if text selected); otherwise echo `^C` and clear line |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste from kill ring |

In VS Code mode the kill ring is the system clipboard, so killed/copied text
can be pasted into other applications. In the CLI the kill ring is
session-local.

### Terminal control

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear screen and redraw |
| `Ctrl+D` | Disconnect and exit |

---

## Built-in commands

These are handled by the terminal itself and never sent to the server.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/help` | Show this list of built-in commands and keyboard shortcuts |
| `/clear` | Clear the terminal screen |
| `/reconnect` | Manually reconnect to the server |
| `/disconnect` | Disconnect (stays open; use `Ctrl+D` to also exit) |
| `/reload-commands` | Force a fresh crawl of the server's command tree (local mode only) |
| `/clear-cache` | Delete the cached command tree for this server (local mode only) |
| `/cache-info` | Show the age and location of the cached command tree |

Any command that does **not** start with `/`, or that starts with `/` but is
not in the list above, is sent directly to the server as an RCON command.

---

## Tab completion modes

The terminal detects which mode to use automatically when it first connects.

**Plugin mode** (preferred) — requires the
[RconTabComplete](https://github.com/pop4959/RconTabComplete) plugin on the
server. Completions are fetched live from the server as you type, identical to
in-game tab completion.

**Local mode** (fallback) — the terminal fetches and parses your server's
`/help` output once, builds a command tree, and caches it to disk. Subsequent
connections load from cache (nearly instant). Use `/reload-commands` to
refresh after a server update.

Cache location:
- VS Code: `<extension global storage>/command-cache/<host>_<port>.json`
- CLI: `~/.config/minecraft-rcon/command-cache/<host>_<port>.json`

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Connection refused"** — verify `enable-rcon=true` in `server.properties`
and that the RCON port is not blocked by a firewall.

**"Authentication failed"** — double-check `rcon.password` in
`server.properties`. Passwords are case-sensitive.

**Autocomplete not working in local mode**
1. `/clear-cache` to discard the old tree
2. `/reload-commands` to re-crawl
3. Check that your account has permission to run `/help` on the server
4. In VS Code, check View → Output → Minecraft RCON for crawl diagnostics

**Truncated responses** — this was a bug in versions before v2.0, which used
an external library with a 4096-byte limit. The current implementation has no
such limit.

**Suggestion display looks wrong** — try `/clear` to redraw the screen. If
the issue persists in the CLI, ensure your terminal reports correct dimensions
(`echo $COLUMNS $LINES`).

## Contributing

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jaketcooper/minecraft-rcon.git
cd minecraft-rcon
npm install
npm run compile
npm test
```

The test suite runs inside VS Code's extension host. Run it with `npm test`; no
live server is required — the RCON layer has a record/replay fixture harness.
